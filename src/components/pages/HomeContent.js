					I'm Josiah, a software developer specializing in web-based apps
					and projects, in both Front-end and Back-end capacities.
					Creating new things is my passion, and learning along the way is
					just part of the fun!

					I would love to help you make your ideas and projects a reality!
					Feel free to look around my site for more info and examples on

					This page is meant to display my current abilities in terms of
					front-end design, and will evolve as my skills develop further
					and I increase the breadth of my portfolio. I have designed and
					implemented this single-page web application from the ground up
					myself using React.js and my own CSS styling, and I hope this
					gives you a good sample of my talents, and insight into my
					skillsets and journey in web development.
